# UnderseaPCG
Construct undersea terrain by using marching cubes and cellular automata
## Video Demonstration
* The video demonstration is available to view [here](https://youtu.be/V4uGz-TVKuw?si=RtswYu7WBxor7ZFL).
## Introduction
* **This project was built for the Interactive Agents and Procedural Generation (ECS7016P) module at Queen Mary, University of London**.
* The aim of the project is to simulate the undersea environmnet.
* The terrain is procedurally generated by two techniques: cellular automata and marching cubes
* The npc is controlled by behavior trees
